# What this website is?

Hello fellow developersðŸ‘‹, my name is Faizan Shaik I am a final year undergrad kid who obsessed with backend engineering technologies and cloud. I love cloudflare and vercel, I like building small blocks of logic and piecing them together to orchestrate work. Since a kid I have always been tinkering with any new technology that my hands could find and right now I am tinkering with distributed systems, operating systems and machine learning code.

You'll find me ranting about Football(Hala Madrid!), F1(LECLERECCCCCCCC!) and UFC(rooting for Tom Aspinal to fight Jon Jones) or how bad javascript/java frameworks are(I still love them).

The goal of this blog is for me to get in a habit of constant learning and writing, for the majority part of my studies I didn't journal my learning I just did stuff which did land me at internships with amazing companies but right now in the age of AI being mediocre isn't enough anymore.

I am good at learning stuff, implementing features for a product but I struggle with first principle thinking and I have no good ideas for projects, it feels like I am at a rut so this is where I push myself.

From today I'll be (hopefully) publishing a new blog on computer science foundations -> backend systems and a lot of MATH.

I have an intern for 2026 summer at Atlan as a Backend intern! Algorithms + Math are what I am bat at and at the same time they excite me more. The world of computing is changing, we are at the bring of redifining computer + accessibility for everyone.

Currently on Omarchy an Opinionated Arch linux setup.

Nice to have you here ðŸ˜„!
