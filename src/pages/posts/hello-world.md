# What is this website?

Hello fellow developers 👋! My name is Faizan Shaik. I’m a final-year undergraduate student obsessed with backend engineering technologies and the cloud. I love Cloudflare and Vercel. I enjoy building small blocks of logic and piecing them together to orchestrate complex systems.

Since I was a kid, I’ve always been tinkering with new technologies—whatever I could get my hands on. Right now, I’m exploring distributed systems, operating systems, and machine learning code.

You’ll find me ranting about Football (Hala Madrid ⚪🤍), F1 (LECLERECCCCCCCC! 🏎️), and UFC (rooting for Tom Aspinall to fight Jon Jones 🥊), or about how bad JavaScript/Java frameworks can be (even though I still love them).

The goal of this blog is to develop a habit of continuous learning and writing. For most of my studies, I didn’t document my progress—I just built things, which fortunately landed me internships at some amazing companies. But now, in the age of AI, being mediocre just isn’t enough anymore.

I’m good at learning new things and implementing features for products, but I struggle with first-principles thinking and generating interesting project ideas. It feels like I’m in a bit of a rut, so this blog is where I’ll push myself.

Starting today, I’ll (hopefully) be publishing new blogs on computer science foundations, backend systems, and a lot of math!

I have a summer 2026 internship lined up at **Atlan** as a Backend Intern! Algorithms and math are the areas I’m _bad_ at—but they’re also the ones that excite me the most. The world of computing is changing fast—we’re on the brink of redefining computing and accessibility for everyone.

Currently running **Omarchy**, my opinionated Arch Linux setup.

Nice to have you here 😄!
